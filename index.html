                <p>Good day! I am Luis Eduardo Montenegro Llamozas, a BYU-Pathway student aspiring to be a software developer. I was born in Venezuela 22 years ago. Since I was a child, I had a strong fondness for technology and video games, and this fondness eventually became my main focus of attention. In my adolescence, I realized that I wanted to dedicate myself to creating software (and maybe some video games in my spare time), so I decided to learn the basics of programming to someday start on the right foot in my career. That day has arrived, and I am very excited to progress on this path and do my best to make my goals and dreams come true. I strive always to learn more and improve my skills because I know that with time and a lot of commitment, even though it seems far away, I can become a great professional in this career. I will never give up, I will not quit, and I will always keep in mind the future I want to achieve!</p>
